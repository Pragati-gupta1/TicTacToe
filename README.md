# Tic-Toe-Game

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic and timeless game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. With advancements in technology, you can now play this beloved game right on your computer.

The user interface of the Tic Tac Toe game is created using HTML and CSS, providing a visually appealing and intuitive design. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid, resembling the traditional Tic Tac Toe layout.

JavaScript is used to implement the game's logic and functionality. When a player clicks on an empty cell, the JavaScript code detects the click event and determines whose turn it is (either "X" or "O"). The corresponding mark is then placed in the selected cell on the grid.

The CSS styling adds visual appeal to the game, with customizable colors, fonts, and animations. It enhances the user experience by providing visual cues for player turns, highlighting winning combinations, and displaying a clear and responsive design.
